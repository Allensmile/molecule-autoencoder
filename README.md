# molecule-autoencoder
A project to enable optimization of molecules by transforming them to and from a continuous representation.


This is the code used for the this paper:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02415


This code requires a fork of Keras that forked from the dev version around approximately version 0.3.2 and Theano 0.8.2.  We want to point you to the work of Max Hodak who re-implemented this tool based on the paper.  For beginning your own project, you may have greater success starting there.  https://github.com/maxhodak/keras-molecules
